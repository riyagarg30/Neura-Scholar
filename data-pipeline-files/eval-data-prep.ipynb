The definition of E U is equivalent to that of EU, except we have re stricted to states AB of the form U0 A B. We may take the maximum rather than the supremum, because this is a continuous function on a compact set. Clearly these two definitions are more restrictive than Eqs. and , so we have E U EU and E U EU. Also, because we may take U0 to be the identity, E U E U . As motivation for these definitions, for a range of two qubit unitaries the equalities E . In addition, U A B is the state that is equivalent to U under the Jamio lkowski isomorphism . That is, U A B may be used to implement U by postselecting on particular Bell measurement results. The probability of obtaining the correct measurement re sults is dAU dBU 2. It is possible for the entanglement to increase for one particular measurement result, so it is possible for E U to be strictly less than EU. However, the entanglement when averaged over all possible measurement results can not increase, so we must have E U dAU dBU 2 EU. We do not obtain a similar relationship between E U and EU, because if the initial target state has entanglement, the total entanglement can decrease by more than E U for some measurement results. In fact, the ratio of EU to E U is unbounded, as is easily seen for the case of the unitary U exp i z z see Fig. 1 . We also define entangling capacities with the state only restricted on one side or the other E , U sup B E U A B , E , U sup B,U0 E UU0 A B E U0 A B , E , U sup B E U A B , E , U sup B,U0 E UU0 A B E U0 A B . From the definitions it is clear that E U E , U EU and E U E , U EU. Throughout this paper we use the asterisk to indicate either or . Next we consider what happens if we allow the dimen sions of HAU and HBU to be expanded. That is, we may take HB1 U HB2 U , and allow U to act upon HAU HBU , although it only acts as the identity upon HA2 U and HB2 U . In this case, we find that E , . For the example of E , U , the result may be shown in the following way. We take the initial state A BU , where is a state giving a change in entanglement within o of the supremum in . We take , . The dimension of HA2 U is taken to be equal to that of Alice s ancilla in AB with the subsystems as in the definition , the dimension of HB2 U is equal to that of Bob s ancilla in AB, and the dimension of HB3 U is\n",

The operation U0 is taken to swap the states of the subsystems HAU and HBU,3, giving Aanc,B3 U AU ,B1 U ,B2 U . Because U only acts nontrivially on HA1 U HB1 U , the change in entanglement under U is EU o . As we may take o to be arbitrarily small, E , . All communication capacitites considered here are un altered if larger dimensions are permitted for HAU and HBU . Therefore, any relations that can be proven for E , U also hold for EU. The only other capacity which we consider in this work that may depend on the dimen sions of HAU and HBU is E U . However, in this case it does not appear that it simplifies to EU under an expanded dimension. 3 B. Holevo capacities Next we define a range of capacities for increasing the Holevo information. An ensemble is a set of states that are supplied with probabilities pj. The ensemble is denoted by . The Holevo information of the ensemble E is given by E S X j pjS j , where P j pj j. This quantity gives the asymptotic communication that may be performed using an ensem ble by coding over multiple copies . The Holevo capacities are defined by U sup pj,V A j , AB pj, TrAUV A j AB , U sup pj,V B j , AB pj, TrBUV B j AB , U sup E TrAUE TrAE , U sup E TrBUE TrBE . Here V A j and V B j are local unitaries that act in Alice and Bob s subsystems, respectively. Throughout we use the convention that the superscripts on local operators indicate the subsystems they act upon. We also use the notation conventions TrX TrX , UE , TrXE . We also omit the curly brackets when directly taking the Holevo information of an ensemble. The capacities U and U are the capacities for ob taining Holevo information on Bob and Alice s sides, re spectively, without initial correlations. The capacities U and U are the capacities for increasing the Holevo information on Bob and Alice s sides, respectively. These capacities give the asymptotic communication ca pacities from Alice to Bob and Bob to Alice, respectively . From the definitions it is clear that U U indicates or . One may also define Holevo capacities for initially un entangled states U sup pj, j A, B pj, TrAU j A B , U sup pj, A, j B pj, TrBU A j B , U sup pj, j A, j B pj, TrAU j A j B pj, TrA j A j B , U sup pj, j A, j B pj, TrBU j A j B pj, TrB j A j B . These capacities are more restrictive than those in Eqs. to , so U U and U U. It is also clear from the definitions that U U . In Ref. it was shown that U EU and U EU. In addi tion, it was shown that, for controlled unitary operations, . III. RELATIONS BETWEEN CAPACITIES A. Symmetry The capacities E U and E U differ from the usual ca pacities in that they are intrinsically time symmetric. That is, E U , E U . To show this for E U , note that U A U AancBanc A B. Here we use superscripts on U to indicate that it is acting on the ancillas otherwise it is acting upon HAU HBU . As is symmetric under exchange of the system and the ancilla, we have E U AancBanc A B E U A B\n",
